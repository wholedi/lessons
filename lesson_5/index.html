                    Technological advancement has always had a strong impact on society, and education is no exception.
                    With
                    the development of information technology, the Internet and artificial intelligence, educational
                    systems
                    around the world are facing major changes. In this article, we look at which technology trends are
                    shaping the future of education and what benefits and challenges they present.

                    The Internet and digital technologies have made education accessible to millions of
                    people around the world. Online courses, webinars and distance learning programs allow students from
                    different countries to receive quality education without leaving their homes.
                    <span class="highlights">
                    This is especially true during
                    the COVID-19 pandemic, when many educational institutions have switched to an online format.

                <p>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) provide new opportunities for interactive learning.
                    With

                    fields
                    such as medicine or engineering.

                    integrate technology into educational systems, it is necessary to carefully consider ethical and
                    social aspects and ensure equal opportunities for all students.

                    Technology is a powerful tool for
